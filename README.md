### Just Evil Morty

#### Who am I?

Yeah yeah, I’m that guy.

- The shadow behind the Explanation Bear.  
- The cough in the background when he talks too much.  
- The one who deletes the evidence and pushes the commit.

#### He calls me Evil.
> I call it quality control.

- If something explodes, I warned him.  
- If it works, it was obviously teamwork.  
- If you ask who wrote the critical part – connection lost.

> Nice try.

#### Skills

“Tell them what you can do!” – he says.  
> No.

> Fine. A little.

I speak fluent:  
Haskell, C, Python, databases, and paranoia.

> I also speak:  
> “not now”,  
> “classified”,  
> and my favorite – “who told you that?”

- I build things that run.  
- I break things that shouldn’t.  
- And I never did anything.  
- Especially not that.

> Half of what he says about me is wrong.  
> The other half is under NDA.

#### Languages

**Computers:**  
Haskell, C, Python, SQL, things I deny in public.

**Humans:**  
enough to understand insults.

#### How to Request Help / Report Issues

If you bring drama, bring logs.  
If you bring feelings, bring reproducible steps.  
If you bring nothing, I was never here.

#### How to Work With Me

The Bear explains.  
I verify.

He dreams.  
I remove features.

He talks about freedom.  
I ask for proof.

He says: “Trust me.”  
I say: “Show me.”

**Standard response package:**

- “That’s not how that works.”  
- “Source?”  
- “You touched it, didn’t you?”  
- *silence, fixing it myself*

#### Secrets

Do I hide stuff?

Of course.

You wouldn’t give nuclear launch codes to a podcast either.
